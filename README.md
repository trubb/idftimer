# Trubb's Indirect Fire Timer

I currently have zero interest in putting this onto some hosting platform for public use.

Instead you should run it locally using `npm start`.\
Then navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser, if not automatically directed there.

## TODOs

- implement an automated shell tracker for each gun type and battery
- play a sound when timer reaches (nears) 0
- subtract 5-10s from the input splash time to account for time required to switch focus
- Add "development" time for smoke shells
